# Jud's Dotfiles

This set of configuration items gets my Mac set up just how I like it.

The repo was originally forked from [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles),
but has drifted far beyond that original configuration. Thanks for the inspiration!


## Installation

Clone the repository, then run the following:

```bash
./prep.sh
./base.sh
```

Close your terminal and open the newly-installed iTerm. Also open the following apps
and login to them (if applicable) to get their initial configurations established

*  `chrome`
*  `keepingyouawake`
*  `subl`

Finally run the following:

```bash
./dev.sh
./macos.sh
```
